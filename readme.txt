For github:
	Media is not include, too much and too big.



What I've done:
	Track				100%
	camera  			100%
	objects impliment		100% 
(some files have conflict with mech.hpp I don't understand why, and it only happends on obj files,
blend files do not have color or texture, and not all objects have mlt file which means it cannot read texture of it's own.)

instructions:

	Press the U,I,O to increase transformations

	Press the J,K,L to decrease transformations

		Shift+Key will alter scale
		Control+Key will alter translation
		Key along will alter rotation rate

	Pressing Comma will increase transformation Step
	Pressing Period will decrease transformation Step
	Pressing G will reset transformations
	Pressing Q will toggle Quaternion Rotation
	Pressing B will toggle reflections for the box textures
	Pressing H will toggle heightmap
	Pressing N will toggle Normals       (do not conclude nanosuit and other objs, because there is a conflict, 
						and I think there is something wrong in mech.hpp, which we haven't study yet.)
	Pressing F will get on the track
	Pressing T will change Track texture (2 texture and reflection texture)
	Pressing C will toggle car
	Pressing V will change car
	Pressing P will print information

	Changing texture of tracks
